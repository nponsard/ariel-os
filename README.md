Ariel OS is an operating system for secure, memory-safe, low-power Internet of Things (IoT).
Ariel OS is based on Rust from the ground up.
Hardware targets include varieties of hardware based on 32-bit microcontroller architectures (such as Cortex-M, RISC-V, Xtensa).
Check out our [table of supported hardware](https://ariel-os.github.io/ariel-os/dev/docs/book/hardware_functionality_support.html).

## Design

Ariel OS builds on top of existing projects in the Embedded Rust ecosystem, including [Embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy), [esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal), [defmt](https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt), [probe-rs](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs), [sequential-storage](https://github.com/tweedegolf/sequential-storage), and [embedded-test](https://github.com/probe-rs/embedded-test) among others.
While those provide high-quality building blocks for a wide range of embedded applications, such projects do not provide the high level of integration that developers know from contemporary C-based operating systems for microcontrollers, such as [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/) or [Zephyr](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr) for instance.

Ariel OS thus follows an approach whereby it simultaneously integrates many heterogeneous pre-existing crates, and adds missing operating system functionalities such as a preemptive multicore scheduler, portable peripheral APIs, additional network security facilities, as well as [laze](https://github.com/kaspar030/laze), a meta-build system to bind it all together.
The result?
A powerful framework that allows to write portable embedded Rust applications with minimal boilerplate, providing a batteries-included experience.


## Getting Started

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

Ariel OS makes use of selected Rust unstable features. For the time being, it is
recommended to use the nightly version pinned by [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml).
