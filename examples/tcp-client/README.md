# tcp-client

## About

[Embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy) _networking_ usage with Ariel OS.

## How to run

In this directory, run

Ariel OS will reply to ping requests on 10.42.0.61 and host a TCP service on
port 1234 that will echo the input back to the client. It can be accessed with
e.g., `telnet`:

    telnet 10.42.0.61 1234
