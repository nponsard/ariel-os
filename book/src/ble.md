## Bluetooth Low Energy

Ariel os provides an abstraction over [TrouBLE](https://github.com/embassy-rs/trouble). The hardware specific initialization is handled by Ariel OS for supported chips.

### Enabling the BLE stack

BLE is enabled by selecting one or both of the BLE [laze modules][laze-modules-book] depending on your use case:

- `ble-peripheral`: for advertising data, acting as a "sever".
- `ble-central`: for scanning and connecting to peripherals, reading their data.

If you want to learn more about BLE concepts, you can read the [TrouBLE documentation](https://embassy.dev/trouble/#_concepts).

### Optional configuration

There are some settings exposed via environment variables that you may want to change depending on your use case:

- `CONFIG_BLE_MTU`: Maximum Transmission Unit (unit: bytes), the default is 27 for better compatibility, newer versions of BLE allow for up to 251.
- `CONFIG_BLE_MAX_CONNS`: Maximum number of concurrent connections to be handled by the BLE stack, the default is 1 to reduce memory usage. If you need to connect to multiple devices or serve multiple devices, increase this value.
- `CONFIG_BLE_MAX_CHANNELS`: Maximum number of concurrent channels to be handled by the BLE stack, the default is 1 to reduce memory usage. Increase this value if you want to use multiple channels. GATT services use only one channel.

### Configure a static address for debugging/testing

By default Ariel OS will use the registered (public) address of the module or generate one from the device identity. It is recommended to keep this behavior when deploying your application.

For debugging/testing purposes or when developing a BLE driver you may need to set the address to a static value. To do that, select the `ble-config-static-mac` [laze module][laze-modules-book] and set your wanted address using the `CONFIG_BLE_STATIC_MAC` environment variable. The expected format is a hexadecimal representation of the 6 bytes address, colon separator is optional. Example: `CONFIG_BLE_STATIC_MAC=02:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa`.

### Using the BLE stack

To use BLE in your application, you need to get the pre-configured stack and build the host object from it:

```rust
let stack = ariel_os::ble::ble_stack().await;
let host = stack.build();
```

Here `stack` is of type [`trouble_host::Stack`](https://docs.embassy.dev/trouble-host/0.1.0/default/struct.Stack.html) and `host` is of type [`trouble_host::Host](https://docs.embassy.dev/trouble-host/0.1.0/default/struct.Host.html)

You then need to run the runner background task in your application.

```rust
host.runner.run().await;
```

> Note: the runner has other options like `run_with_handler(&lt;handler&gt;) that you may want to use (when scanning for example).

This function will return a result only when a critical error happened in the BLE stack. For most use cases you will need to execute code alongside the runner in the same task (that accesses elements of the `stack` or `host`), you can do that using `embassy_futures::join::join`:

```rust
embassy_futures::join::join(host.runner.run(), async {
  // Execute BLE-related code here that use `host` or `stack`
}).await;
```

See [examples](https://github.com/ariel-os/ariel-os/tree/main/examples) for more details.
