# Debug Console

<!-- NOTE: "Currently" because it could be extended with other semihosting functionality to make it an actual console. -->
The debug console is currently conceptually composed of the [debug channel output][debug-channel-book] and of the ability for the target to close it (when supported).
The debug console is enabled by default and the corresponding [laze module][laze-modules-book] is `debug-console`.

## Printing on the Debug Console

When the `logging-over-debug-channel` [laze module][laze-modules-book] is enabled, [logs][logging-book] are printed on the [debug channel output][debug-channel-book].

## Closing the Debug Console from Firmware

When using [semihosting][semihosting-book], it is possible for the target to request the debug console to exit, and to return an exit code indicating success or failure.
In Ariel OS, the [`ariel_os::debug::exit()` function][debug-exit-fn-rustdoc] can be used for this.
When using a host tool that supports semihosting, this will cause the tool to exit, with the exit code given to [`exit()`][debug-exit-fn-rustdoc] on the target being passed to the host.

The laze configuration automatically enables semihosting on the target when the host tool used *for flashing* supports semihosting (e.g., probe-rs).
When the flashing tool does not, support for semihosting can still be enabled in the firmware by selecting the `semihosting` [laze module][laze-modules-book].
This is needed to later be able to attach a semihosting-enabled host tool to the target.

> [!NOTE]
> When semihosting is enabled on the target and no host tool supporting semihosting (or a debugger) is connected, calling [`ariel_os::debug::exit()`][debug-exit-fn-rustdoc] may result in a panic.
> For example on ESP using `espflash` you would get:
>
> ```
> [ERROR] panicked at 'Unhandled interrupt on ProCpu' (esp_hal src/interrupt/mod.rs:90)
> ```
