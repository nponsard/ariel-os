#### Additional Notes

##### USB Ports

This board features two USB ports: one is labeled "USB" while the other is labeled "UART".

The "USB" port is connected to the USB CDC-ACM/JTAG USB peripheral of the MCU and can be used to flash the board either through the bootloader over USB CDC-ACM using `espflash`, or over JTAG using probe-rs.
It can also be used to obtain logs when the [`logging-over-usb`](../logging.md#logging-transports) laze module is enabled.

The "UART" port is connected to a USB ⟷ UART adapter, wired to UART0.
It can be used to flash the board through the bootloader using `espflash`.
It can also be used to obtain logs when the [`logging-over-uart`](../logging.md#logging-transports) laze module is enabled.

Note: On the ESP32-C3, enabling `logging-over-uart` will [not prevent the logs from also being printed using the USB CDC-ACM USB peripheral](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/issues/4510).
