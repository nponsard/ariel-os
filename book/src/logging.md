# Logging

Ariel OS supports logging on all platforms and it is enabled by default with the `logging` [laze module][laze-modules-book].
Logging offers a set of macros that print on the debug console with helpful logging formatting.

## Printing Panics

Panics are automatically printed on the logging output.
If this is unwanted, the `panic-printing` [laze module][laze-modules-book] can be disabled.

## Logging

Within Rust code, import `ariel_os::log` items, then use Ariel OS logging macros:

```rust
use ariel_os::log::info;

#[ariel_os::task(autostart)]
async fn main() {
    info!("Hello!");
}
```

## Filtering Logs

In Ariel OS, the log level defaults to `info`. It can be configured using the
laze variable `LOG`.
Depending on the logger, it may be possible to configure different levels per crate or per module.

Example:

```shell
$ laze build -C examples/log --builders nrf52840dk -DLOG=info run
```

## Logging Facades and Loggers

Ariel OS supports multiple logging facades and loggers.
Only one of them may be enabled at a time;
if none of them are enabled, logging statements become no-operations.
Enabling either the `defmt` or `log` [laze modules][laze-modules-book] allows selecting which logging facade and logger is used.
defmt should be preferred when possible as it results in smaller binaries.

> [!TIP]
> The `defmt` laze module is favored and enabled by default when possible for
> the target.
> Applications that specifically depend on it still need to explicitly
> [select][laze-modules-book] it to make the dependency explicit and increase
> robustness to potential future changes.

The precise set of formatting operations and traits required on formatted data
depends on the selected backend.
There are some wrapper structs available in the [`ariel_os::log`] module
that help represent some types in a portable way;
in particular, this includes [`Debug2Format`] and [`Display2Format`],
which (while defeating some of `defmt`'s optimizations) come in handy when debugging third party types.

[`Display2Format`]: https://ariel-os.github.io/ariel-os/dev/docs/api/ariel_os/log/struct.Display2Format.html

### [defmt]

See the [defmt documentation] for general info on the defmt's facade and logger.

The defmt logger supports configuring the log level per crate and per module, as follows:

```shell
$ laze build -C examples/log --builders nrf52840dk -DLOG=info,ariel_os_rt=trace run
```

### [log]

Ariel OS's logger for `log` supports configuring the log level globally, but does not currently support per-crate filtering.

## Logging Transports

Logging can use various transports, but currently only one can be used at a time.
The table below presents those supported in Ariel OS and which hardware and host tool are required:

| Logging transport                        | Supported               | laze module                  | Required hardware                                                                         | Required host tool              |
| ---------------------------------------- | :---------------------: | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| [Debug channel][debug-channel-book]      | Available on all chips  | `logging-over-debug-channel` | Debug probe attached to the debug interface                                               | Debug channel-enabled host tool |
| [USB CDC-ACM][usb-cdc-acm-glossary-book] | On ESP32 MCUs only      | `logging-over-usb`           | USB cable attached to the user USB port                                                   | Serial monitor                  |
| [UART][uart-glossary-book]               | On ESP32 MCUs only      | `logging-over-uart`          | USB ⟷ UART adapter attached to the supported UART pins (may already be part of the board) | Serial monitor                  |

On ESP32 devices, Ariel OS uses [`espflash`][espflah-cratesio] by default to obtain and print logs, whose usage is determined by the `espflash` [laze module][laze-modules-book].
When `espflash` is selected at the time of compilation, `logging-over-debug-channel` is not enabled and one of the other available logging transports is used instead.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using [`defmt` as logging facade](#defmt), a `defmt`-enabled host tool must be used so that logs are rendered correctly, as `defmt` uses its own encoding on the wire.
> probe-rs and `espflash` both support `defmt`'s encoding transparently.
>
> When a separate serial monitor is needed, [`defmt-print`][defmt-print-cratesio] can be used as `defmt`-enabled serial monitor.
> If this is not possible, `defmt` should be disabled and [`log`](#log) used instead as logging facade.

> [!TIP]
> When a logging transport other than the [debug channel][debug-channel-book] is enabled, logging can still be used when the debug channel is disabled either in software (by disabling the `logging-over-debug-channel` laze module) or in hardware when the debug interface itself is disabled.
> This means that logging can still be used in production, even if the debug interface has been disabled.
>
> If this is unwanted, logging can be disabled altogether by disabling the [`logging`](#logging) laze module.

> [!NOTE]
> Future plans for logging facilities:
>
> - Other logging transports will later be supported, including UART and USB CDC-ACM on non-ESP32 devices.
> - Using multiple transports at the same time may be supported in the future.
