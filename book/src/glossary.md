# Glossary

- **[ARM (or Arm)][arm-arch-wikipedia]:** a family of instruction set architectures.

- **[Arm (Arm Holdings)][arm-holdings]:** the company behind the ARM architecture family.

- **[Chip][integrated-circuit-wikipedia]:** an integrated circuit (IC).

- **[Cortex-M][cortex-m-wikipedia]:** a family of 32-bit processor implementations from Arm.

- **[ESP32][esp32-wikipedia]:** a family of 32-bit microcontrollers from Espressif.
  Its older microcontrollers are based on the Xtensa architecture, while newer ones use RISC-V.
  Can also specifically refer to the eponymous ESP32 microcontroller.

- **[Embassy][embassy-homepage]:** a software project developing HALs for multiple microcontroller families (e.g., [`embassy-nrf`][embassy-nrf-embassydev], [`embassy-rp`][embassy-rp-embassydev], [`embassy-stm32`][embassy-stm32-embassydev]), along with other components (e.g., [`embassy-executor`][embassy-executor-docsrs], [`embassy-time`][embassy-time-docsrs]).

- **[esp-hal][esp-hal-homepage]:** a HAL for ESP32 microcontrollers, developed by their manufacturer Espressif.

- **HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer):** a software layer that makes specific pieces of hardware (e.g., microcontroller peripherals) easier to use, by hiding some of their details.

- **[MCU][microcontroller-wikipedia]:** a microcontroller.
  Contains a processor, memory, and peripherals to interact with the outside world.

- **nRF:** a family of 32-bit microcontrollers developed by Nordic Semiconductor.

- **Raspberry Pi:** can refer to the [family of single-board computers][raspberry-pi-sbc-wikipedia] or to [Raspberry Pi Holdings][raspberry-pi-holdings-wikipedia], the company that manufactures them as well as RP microcontrollers.
  Sometimes abbreviated to "RPi."

- **[RISC-V][risc-v-wikipedia]:** an open, royalty-free instruction set architecture.

- **RP:** a family of 32-bit microcontrollers designed by Raspberry Pi, which includes the RP2040 and RP2350 microcontrollers.

- **[SoC (System on Chip)][system-on-chip-wikipedia]:** often synonymous with microcontroller in practice, at least in the embedded domain.
  Sometimes used to emphasize the presence of a sizable analog component (usually for radio).

- **[STM32][stm32-wikipedia]:** a family of 32-bit microcontrollers developed by STMicroelectronics.

- **[Xtensa][xtensa-wikipedia]:** a family of instruction set architectures, used in some ESP32 microcontrollers.
