# Universal Serial Bus (USB)

Ariel OS integrates support for USB peripherals built into many microcontrollers.

## Hardware Support

### Supported USB Standards

Many microcontrollers supported by Ariel OS include a USB microcontroller peripheral that can be leveraged to build any USB device.
At the time of writing, most of them support USB 2.0, but their signaling rate is often limited to 12 Mbit/s, even though some also do support 480 Mbit/s.
The following table summarizes the standard signaling rates and their names:

| Signaling rate | Standard                                 |
| -------------: | ---------------------------------------- |
| 12 Mbits/s     | Full-Speed USB (now aka Basic-Speed USB) |
| 480 Mbits/s    | Hi-Speed USB                             |

Some also support USB On-The-Go (OTG), allowing the device to also behave as a USB Targeted Host on the same USB receptacle (by alternatively switching between the peripheral and host roles).
Currently only the USB peripheral (device) role is supported by Ariel OS.
The USB host role is not supported.

### USB Microcontrollers Peripherals

Currently, Ariel OS applications can only make use of "generic" USB peripherals, that is, USB microcontroller peripherals that can be used to implement any USB device class.
Some microcontrollers also feature USB microcontroller peripherals that only support a fixed set of USB classes: e.g., multiple ESP32 MCUs comprise a USB CDC-ACM/JTAG peripheral, which can only be used for the standard [USB CDC-ACM][usb-cdc-acm-book-glossary] device class or a vendor-specific device class implementing JTAG access over USB.
The others may still be integrated by Ariel OS to implement specific functionality, like [logging][logging-transports-book].

> [!TIP]
> Development kits that support USB often feature two USB receptacles: one for the onboard [debug probe][debug-probes-book] (if there is one), and the other connected to the USB peripheral of the microcontroller.
> That second USB connection is usually called "user USB" to differentiate it from that of the debug probe and is the one that must be connected to the computer acting as USB host.

## Software Integration

Ariel OS provides support for the USB peripheral role through [`embassy-usb`][embassy-usb-docsrs], which provides a consistent API across the supported hardware.
It can be enabled with the `usb` Cargo feature.

An instance of [`embassy_usb::Builder`][ariel-os-usbbuilder-rustdoc] is created by Ariel OS, on which support for well-known USB device classes can be added using a dedicated [Ariel OS task hook][task-attr-docs]:

```rust
#[ariel_os::task(autostart, usb_builder_hook)]
async fn main() {
    let mut usb_class = USB_BUILDER_HOOK
        .with(|builder| {
            // USB class constructor that mutates the builder.
        })
        .await;
}
```

Support for well-known USB device classes is provided by `embassy-usb`, which is re-exported as [`ariel_os::reexports::embassy_usb`][ariel-os-reexports-embassy-usb-rustdoc].
Custom USB device classes can also be implemented.
Additionally, multiple USB device classes can be added on the builder, to create a composite USB device.

### USB Device Classes

The table below lists some of the well-known USB device classes and how to use them in Ariel OS :

| Device class                             | How to use                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [USB CDC-ACM][usb-cdc-acm-book-glossary] | Apply the [`CdcAcmClass`][ariel-os-embassy-usb-cdcacmclass-rustdoc] constructor on the builder                                                |
| [USB CDC-NCM][usb-cdc-ncm-glossary-book] | Enable the [`usb-ethernet` laze module][usb-ethernet-laze-module-book]                                                                        |
| USB HID                                  | Enable the `usb-hid` Cargo feature and apply the [`HidReaderWriter`][ariel-os-embassy-usb-hidreaderwriter-rustdoc] constructor on the builder |

[Other well-known device classes][ariel-os-embassy-usb-class-rustdoc] are supported, and it is also possible to implement custom ones.

### Device Configuration

[Configuration for the USB device][ariel-os-embassy-usb-config-rustdoc] created can be provided using the [`#[ariel_os::config(usb)]`][config-attr-macro-rustdoc] attribute.
In particular, it allows setting the Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID), and the manufacturer and product names.

Additionally, some environment variables are used by [`embassy-usb`][ariel-os-reexports-embassy-usb-rustdoc] for configuration.
See its documentation for more.

### Clock Configuration

<!-- NOTE: THE STM32F4 MCUs do *not* support crystal-less USB. -->
As USB microcontroller peripherals rely on specific clock frequencies (to accommodate the signaling rates of USB), they are usually provided with a dedicated clock signal, that is often not shared with other peripherals.
Because USB requires accurate timings[^usb-timings-requirements], the clock source typically relies on a [crystal resonator][crystal-resonator-book] (or an [external crystal oscillator][external-crystal-oscillator]).
When that is not the case, the microcontroller must feature a clock recovery system that is able to recover a clock from the USB Start Of Frame (SOF) packets (sent by the USB host every 1 ms for Full-Speed USB) and that trims an internal oscillator, keeping it in sync with the USB host and thus enabling crystal-less USB.
Many STM32 MCUs feature such clock recovery system (CRS).

To be able to use USB, the [clock configuration][clock-tree-configuration-book] must enable and configure the clock source required for the USB microcontroller peripheral.
[The default clock configuration provided by Ariel OS][clock-tree-configuration-book] usually already configures it appropriately when made possible by the board.
Otherwise, an appropriate clock configuration must be [provided in the application][clock-tree-configuration-book].

[^usb-timings-requirements]: Full-Speed USB requires a bit rate accuracy of 2500 ppm, while Hi-Speed USB requires 500 ppm (see section 7.1.11 of the [USB 2.0 specification][usb-2.0-spec]).
