# Networking

## Enabling Networking

Networking is enabled by selecting the `network` [laze module][laze-modules-book].
When enabled, a network link is automatically selected among the ones available on the target board, currently preferring Wi-Fi networking.
Overriding this default selection is possible by explicitly selecting the desired [network link module](#network-link-selection).

## Network Link Selection

Ariel OS currently supports two different networking links: Ethernet-over-USB (aka CDC-NCM) and Wi-Fi.
Boards may support both of them, only one of them, or none of them. However, currently the network stack supports at most one interface.

Which link layer is used for networking is selected at compile time,
through [laze modules][laze-modules-book].

- `usb-ethernet`: Selects Ethernet-over-USB.
- `wifi-cyw43`: Selects Wi-Fi using the CYW43 chip along an RP2040 or RP235x MCU (e.g., on the Raspberry Pi Pico W or Pico 2 W).
- `wifi-esp`: Selects Wi-Fi on an ESP32 MCU.

## Network Credentials

For Wi-Fi, the network credentials have to be supplied via environment variables:

```sh
CONFIG_WIFI_NETWORK=<ssid> CONFIG_WIFI_PASSWORD=<pwd> laze build ...
```

## Using the Networking Link on the Device

### Network Configuration

DHCPv4 is used by default for network configuration, including for IP address allocation.
This is enabled by the `network-config-dhcp` [laze module](./build-system.md#laze-modules), selected by default.

In order to provide a static configuration, select the `network-config-static` [laze module](./build-system.md#laze-modules), which will take precedence.
The configuration can be customized with the following environment variables:

| Variable                                 | Default      |
| --                                       | --           |
| `CONFIG_NET_IPV4_STATIC_ADDRESS`         | `10.42.0.61` |
| `CONFIG_NET_IPV4_STATIC_CIDR_PREFIX_LEN` | `24`         |
| `CONFIG_NET_IPV4_STATIC_GATEWAY_ADDRESS` | `10.42.0.1`  |

> Non-static IPv6 address allocation will be supported in the future.

### Support for Network Protocols

Support for various network protocols can be enabled through [Cargo features listed in the documentation][rustdoc-homepage].
Most of these use `embassy_net`, which should be used through the [`ariel_os::reexports::embassy_net`][embassy-net-reexport-rustdoc] re-export.

### Using the Network Stack

A network stack handle can then be obtained using [`ariel_os::net::network_stack()`][network-stack-rustdoc].

See the [examples][examples-dir-repo] for details.

## Host Setup

### Static IPv4 Address Configuration

When using a device with a static IPv4 address,
the host computer can be configured as follows (where `host_address` is an IP address configured as gateway for the device):

```
# ip address add <host_address>/24 dev <interface>
# ip link set up dev <interface>
```

To verify that the address has indeed be added, you can use:

```sh
ip address show dev <interface>
```

Replace `<interface>` with the name of the used network interface.
To find out the name of your interface you can use a command such as `ip address`.

### Ethernet-over-USB

For Ethernet-over-USB, ensure that, in addition to the USB cable used for flashing
and debugging, the *user* USB port is also connected to the host computer with
a second cable.
