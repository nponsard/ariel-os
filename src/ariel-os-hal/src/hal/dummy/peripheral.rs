///
/// In practice, this trait allows passing the peripheral ZSTs [obtained through Ariel OS
/// facilities][obtaining-peripheral-access-book] directly to Ariel OS drivers that have a trait
/// bound on [`IntoPeripheral`].
///
/// Note: It is never necessary to implement this trait outside of Ariel OS, and the trait is
/// therefore sealed.
///
/// [obtaining-peripheral-access-book]: https://ariel-os.github.io/ariel-os/dev/docs/book/application.html#obtaining-peripheral-access
// NOTE: Each Ariel OS HAL needs to provide its own definition of this trait, which should be sealed when possible.
