//! Provides a seeded random number generator depending on Ariel OS's configuration.
//!
//! The module provides functions for use by applications, [`fast_rng()`] and [`crypto_rng()`],
//! which produce owned types that provide the [`rand_core::RngCore`] and
//! [`rand_core::CryptoRng`] traits, respectively.
//!
//! The crate abstracts over multiple aspects of RNGs:
//! * Where do we take a valid seed for the RNG from?
//! * What's the type of RNG that we take along?
//! * Is RNG state shared across cores, threads, tasks or not at all?
//!
//! No matter the choices taken (eventually through the application's setup), all is hidden behind
//! the [`FastRng`] and [`CryptoRng`] types.
//!
//! Before accessing the RNG, it needs to be initialized through the [`construct_rng()`] function.
//! This is taken care of by the `ariel-os-embassy` initialization functions. Applications can
//! ensure that this has happened by depending on the laze feature `random`.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! Currently, this provides very little choice, and little fanciness: It (more or less
//! arbitrarily) uses the [`rand_chacha::ChaCha20Rng`] generator as a shared global RNG, and
//! [`rand_pcg::Pcg32`] is decided yet for the fast one. Neither the algorithm nor the size of
//! [`FastRng`] or [`CryptoRng`] is guaranteed.
