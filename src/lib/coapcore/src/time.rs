/// subsequent token to enhance the device's understanding of time).

/// consider switching to an internal u32 based type that expresses Unix time / TAI with an offset
/// -- while the 130 years expressible with it are coming to an end, I'm relatively sure that we
/// can get away with limiting the usable range to 130 years starting from when a concrete firmware
