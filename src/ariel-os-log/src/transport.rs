//! This module provides facilities for registering a custom logging transport from within
//! an application.

// Internal logging transport implementations use the same [`register_custom_transport`] function
// but uses the `internal-transport-driver` feature to access this module.
//
// Logging transport implementations end up depending on the HAL, that then depends on
// `ariel-os-log`, creating a circular dependency. Connecting log transports like this helps break
// the cycle.

/// Registering a custom transport requires providing two functions:
///
/// - `write_bytes_fn` is used to write bytes to the transport. Depending on the logging facade it
///   may be UTF-8 encoded text or raw binary data.
/// - `flush_fn` is used to flush the data in the transport.
///
/// ## Important note
///
/// `write_bytes_fn` and `flush_fn` may be executed inside a critical section, disabling interrupts.
/// They should therefore not wait for interrupts and should not trigger calls to the logging facade.
